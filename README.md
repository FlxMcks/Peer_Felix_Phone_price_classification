# Peer_Felix_Phone_price_classification
Here you can find the code and the documentaition.
There is the phone_price_classification_main.py as the main code. It was not possible to upload the .exe file, because ist was too big.

The used librarys with their version are documented in the requirements.txt. To install all used lybraries use the comand: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

There is a commented section in the text. In this section all plots and diagrams used in the documentation are generated. If the section is commented in, there is an extra button in the GUI to show the plots. 
The generation of all plots can take more than 30 minutes. The first 3 plots take about 5 minutes each and the last one at least 20-30 minutes.
